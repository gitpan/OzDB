Items TODO before the next version:

Accept arguments to allow for debugging messages or not, and
allow for logging and verbosity levels to syslogd and/or a local log
file.

Also, slated for next version, the extension interface to allow the
database to store other information besides OzDB centric applications.

Please submit any contrib at http://support.linuxops.net as a ticket.
Any other requests for TODO items please send in a ticket as well.
